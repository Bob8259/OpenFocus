# AI Smart Screen Recording System - Audio Recording Feature

## Overview

This system is an intelligent screen recording tool that supports click-to-zoom effects and multiple audio recording modes.

### Disclaim
*The code in this project is mainly generated by AI. Please double check before using it!*

### Key Features

- ✅ Smart click-to-zoom effect
- ✅ Smooth camera movement
- ✅ Mouse pointer display & Click animation effects
- ✅ **Mouse drag-to-select recording area**
- ✅ **Four audio recording modes**:
  - No audio
  - System sound only
  - Microphone only
  - Mixed microphone and system sound

## Installation

### Requirements
- This application is only available for **Windows**, preferably **Windows 11**.

### Direct Download
- You can directly download the executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/Bob8259/OpenFocus/releases).

### Usage Guide

1. **Recording Area**:
   - Default is full-screen recording.
   - Click "Select Recording Area" button and drag the mouse to select a custom area.
   - You can re-select the area or restore to full screen.
2. **Zoom Factor**: Set the magnification when clicking (1.0-2.5x).
3. **Smooth Speed**: Set the smoothness of camera movement (0.05-0.5). The higher the Smooth Speed, the faster your screen will move to follow your mouse.
4. **Zoom Duration**: Set how long the zoom effect lasts (0.3-3.0 seconds).
5. **Audio Recording Mode**: Choose how to record audio.
   - **No Audio**: Record video only.
   - **System Sound Only**: Record all sounds played by the computer.
   - **Microphone Only**: Record sound from the microphone input.
   - **Microphone and System**: Record both simultaneously and mix them.
6. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: `Ctrl+F1` to start recording, `Ctrl+F2` to stop and save recording.

(Files are saved in the program directory as `Record_Timestamp.mp4`.)

### DIY Installation
If you want to run from source or customize the code:

#### 1. Create Conda Environment
```bash
conda create -n OpenFoucs python=3.10
conda activate OpenFoucs
```

#### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Install FFmpeg (Required for audio merging)

**Windows:**
1. Visit [FFmpeg Official Website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Download the Windows build
3. Extract to any directory (e.g., `C:/fmpeg`)
4. Add `C:/fmpeg/bin` to your system PATH environment variable
5. Verify installation: Open command prompt and type `ffmpeg -version`

**Quick Install (using Chocolatey):**
```bash
choco install ffmpeg
```

#### Start Program
```bash
python main.py
```

#### Build EXE (Opetional)
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller main.spec
```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Logic

The system follows a straightforward workflow: it records video and audio streams separately and then merges them into a single output using FFmpeg.

### Limitations
**This project is not implemented in C/C++; therefore, it is intended primarily for personal use and may not be suitable for performance-critical or production environments.**

This project may contains bugs, especially for "Microphone & System" Mode.

### Tech Stack

- **UI Framework**: CustomTkinter
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV, mss
- **Audio Recording**: pyaudiowpatch
- **Merging**: FFmpeg
- **Input Listening**: pynput
